								<h1>About Me</h1>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profilefoto.jpg" alt="" /></span>From the moment I started working with 
									data as an undergraduate research assistant at BYU, I was hooked. Digging into large datasets, using R to uncover 
									patterns, and turning raw numbers into compelling visual stories became so natural to me. You may be interested to 
									know that I originally was pursuing a field in clinical research and psychology. However, I became more inclined to 
									learn appropriate methods to prepare data that would drive change and progress in the world. Now, as a data
									analyst, I work with SQL and R to clean, analyze, and visualize data,
									always eager to sharpen my skills and explore new tools. I hope that you find my projects and contributions to data
									meaningful and insightful. I always appreciate feedback, advice, and engagement with my work which you can find on GitHub.
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/IMG_3235.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Outside of my data world, I love to climb the Utah mountain peaks, spend time with my wife, and read a good bookâ€”all of
										which challenge me to see the world from new perspectives and grow. I fully embrace the idea that setbacks make me 
										a better person. Indeed, learning new data tools comes with all sorts of setbacks. Learning R and SQL was easily the most daunting 
										task in my professional development. However, just like the effort and training it takes to hike these towering mountains in the 
										Wasatch, it opens up new abilities and talents I didn't even know I had. Now, analyzing data is like riding a bike, except now its time to
										pedal even faster.<br><strong>"Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air, and behold the view. Climb 
										it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you." - David McCullough Jr.</strong>
