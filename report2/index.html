      <h3>The STAKEHOLDER'S QUESTION</h3>
      <p>Are there any product combinations we should be promoting together because customers often buy them together?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="analysis-section">  
      <h3>The ANSWER</h3>
      <p>Some home decor categories are selling together, but overall product affinity is weak. Most category pairings show low or negative Lift values. This means customers aren't naturally bundling items.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="analysis-section">
      <h3>The SOLUTION</h3>
      <div class="analysis-insights">
          <ul>
            <li>There is a need to add/improve our site's recommendation engine (e.g. "Customers who bought X, also buy Y") to guide smarter cross-category purchases.</li>
            <li>To boost affinity, consider promoting trending combinations on the homepage, offer seasonal bundles, or highlight frequently paired items during checkout.</li>

      <h3>The STAKEHOLDER'S QUESTION</h3>
      <p>Which factors are most influencing customer satisfaction as reflected in product reviews?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="analysis-section">  
      <h3>The ANSWER</h3>
      <p>Larger order sizes and longer delivery times are the strongest drivers of lower review scores. Specifically, larger orders are 2.6× more likely to receive a 1-star rating, and extended delivery windows are linked to decreased satisfaction. In contrast, while total price and payment value are <em>statistically</em> significant, their practical impact on review outcomes is small.</p>

      <h3>The SOLUTION</h3>
      <div class="analysis-insights">
          <ul>
            <li>Use review scores as an early warning system for logistics issues. Flag orders with long lead times or sourcing delays before shipment.</li>
            <li>Prioritize faster fulfillment and shipping for larger orders, which are more likely to receive low ratings.</li>
            <li>Set clearer delivery expectations on-site to reduce frustration from delays and protect satisfaction scores.</li>
            <li>Introduce post-purchase check-ins or support for high-price orders, where expectations (and risk of disappointment) may be higher.</li>
            <li>Focus improvement efforts on operational factors — not price.</li>

            <li>Larger orders are <strong>2.6x more likely</strong> to receive a 1-star rating due to a possibility of <strong>fulfillment strain</strong> or <strong>complexity</strong>.</li>
            <li>Delivery time is a huge driver for customer satisfaction; <strong>longer deliveries</strong> consistently lead to <strong>lower ratings</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher prices</strong> are linked to a <strong>7% increase</strong> in 1-star ratings, suggesting elevated expectations may <strong>backfire</strong>.</li>

      <h3>The STAKEHOLDER'S QUESTION</h3>
      <p>Which Brazilian states are generating the highest revenue through our online e-commerce store? Are there any logistics issues?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="analysis-section">  
      <h3>The ANSWER</h3>
      <p>São Paulo and other urban states lead the way in sales revenue. I'm seeing a handful of reasons for this:
        <li>sellers are mostly located in SP</li>
        <li>population density</li>
        <li>access to fast/reliable shipping</li>
        <br>
        Nonetheless, I also see BIG opportunities for marketing and logistics to upgrade their strategies to CREATE revenue in these more rural states.

      <h3>The SOLUTION</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Target major cities in low-revenue states (e.g. Manaus, São Luis)</li>

            <li>Run ads in high-aov, low-order states where shoppers already spend more</li>
            <li>Offer free shipping for orders above a certain price to eliminate the negative consequences of long delivery times and promote more spending</li>
            <li>Launch micro-fulfillment pilots in North and Center-West regions to speed up order processing</li>

  <h1 class="header">CONCLUSIONS</h1>
  <div class="conclusion">
    <p>
      From this large dataset, I uncovered several key focus areas for Olist's e-commerce business. The following insights highlight opportunities for improvement:
    </p><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Website engagement appears low. Customers may not be diversifying their baskets because the platform primarily directs them to checkout rather than offering a personalized shopping experience.</li>
      <li>Delivery speed significantly impacts customer satisfaction and likely influences repeat purchases. If shopping in-store is easier than waiting for delivery, Olist’s logistics could be the barrier.</li>
      <li>Supply chain inefficiencies emerge when customers purchase multiple products. Lead times, vendor coordination, and inventory management require closer monitoring. Removing low-demand products may reduce strain on warehouse operations.</li>
      <li>Urban hubs like São Paulo drive the most sales, but rural states show strong potential through their high average order values. A portion of revenue should be invested in marketing and logistics campaigns to expand access and engagement in underserved regions.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>What I Learned: <strong>SQL</strong></h2>
    <p>Using CTEs boosted my SQL confidence immensely. Visualizing the desired output before writing queries helped me create efficient "micro-tables" that could be directly loaded into R for targeted visualizations.</p><br>
    <p>Window functions made delivery time calculations far more efficient. They opened a new world for date-based analysis and data comparison.</p><br>

    <h2>What I Learned: <strong>R</strong></h2>
    <p>R is my go-to tool for data cleaning and automation. Having a clean, repeatable script ensures that changes are easy to implement. If you're not already using R or Python for wrangling data, I strongly recommend starting!</p><br>
    <p>While R is known for visualization, its customization options continue to impress me. This project marked my first time creating choropleth maps, and resources like the <a href="https://r-graph-gallery.com/" target="_blank">R Graph Gallery</a> were incredibly helpful.</p><br>

    <h2>What I Learned: <strong>Business Analysis</strong></h2>
    <p>This project opened up countless paths for exploration. My goal was to reflect both in-depth analysis and quick-turnaround insights — the kind stakeholders often rely on from data analysts.</p><br>
    <p>I hope this inspires other analysts to think beyond the code and build business strategies from the data they work with. There’s always more to uncover within the data you're responsible for.</p><br>
