									<h2>National Conference on Undergraduate Research</h2>
									<h6>April 2024 - Long Beach, CA</h6>
									<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Poster.ER-Tavish King.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										This study analyzed how emotion regulation strategies influence mood in Autistic and 
										Socially Anxious adults. Over nine months, participants provided daily self-reports on 
										mood (0–100) and strategy use, generating a dataset with 15,000+ observations. Data was 
										preprocessed in <b>R</b> using <b>tidyverse</b>, including releveling categorical variables, standardizing, 
										merging datasets, and string cleaning with gsub(). A <b>mixed-effects model</b> was applied using <b>lme4</b> 
										to account for the nested structure and repeated measures. All visualizations were created with 
										<b>ggplot2</b>. <br>
										This project reinforced the importance of rigorous data cleaning to ensure accurate 
										analysis and insights.</p>


									<h2>Utah Conference of Undergraduate Research</h2>
									<h6>February 2025 - Cedar City, UT</h6>
									<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/UCUR2025.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											This study explored how motivation and effort influence positive emotions in Autistic 
											and neurotypical adults. We hypothesized that these relationships would be weaker in 
											Autistic individuals. While Autistic adults reported lower average positive emotions, 
											both groups showed similar day-to-day increases in positive emotions with greater 
											motivation and effort. <br>
											Data preprocessing included renaming and filtering columns, 
											reclassifying variables, and creating within-person variables. A <b>mixed-effects model</b> 
											was implemented using <b>lme4</b> in <b>R</b>, with complex functions extracting coefficient data 
											for table generation. Predictor effects were visualized using <b>flexplot</b>.</p>
									
											
									<h2>Society of Pediatric Psychology Annual Conference</h2>
									<h6>April 2025 - Phoenix, AZ</h6>
									<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPPAC2025_Poster.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										This study examined the relationship between HbA1c, time since diagnosis, and 
										BMI on working memory in emerging adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We analyzed 
										data from 35 participants (ages 18–25, M = 21.6), who self-reported their two most 
										recent HbA1c values, time since diagnosis, and BMI. HbA1c and BMI were standardized, 
										while time since diagnosis was mean-centered (min = 2 years). Working memory was 
										assessed using NIH Toolbox List Sorting percentile scores. A multiple regression model 
										was applied to evaluate associations. To visualize the unique contributions of each predictor,
										I leveraged <b>ggplot2</b> in <b>R</b> to generate <b>partial regression plots</b>, effectively isolating covariate 
										effects on working memory. <br>
										This project served as my undergraduate capstone at BYU.
